Coding challenges in CS235

Following is the folder structure to get to the source code:[^1]

- Challenges/Challenges/src/ArrayChallenges/
    - Array1.java
    - Array2.java
    - Array3.java
    - Main.java

## You can mark the files off as completed once reviewed here:
- [X] Array1.java
- [X] Array2.java
- [X] Array3.java
- [ ] Array4.java
- [ ] Main.java


[^1]: In an effort to maintain OOP practices, "Main.java" is used as the main file to run all code. Picture it as the driver.
In it contains the main(). "Array1.java" is the file that contains the code to the first coding challenge that is about Arrays.
"Array2.java" contains the class that relates to the second challenge. "Array3.java" is, you guessed it, the third challenge src code.
So on and so forth.
